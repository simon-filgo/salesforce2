A few things I'd like to see:
- Cycle from opp-quote-order-work-order-appointment-service report-invoice, with documents
-	Best way to include work order types in quote (for example, how to quote a maintenance service).

Create 4 generic service resources for now:
-	Tech1 Heating (tech1@filgo-sonic.ca)
-	Tech2 Heating (tech2@filgo-sonic.ca)
-	Tech3 Fuel (tech3@filgo-sonic.ca)
